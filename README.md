# Predicting Car Prices using Linear Regression

This project aims to use linear regression in order to model car prices using correlated features. Specifically, we'll be using the dataset from the 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook to determine if we can predict the price of a car based on highly associated features and infer the car prices for each feature used.
